    Run make and ./hello in hello_world/ to compile and run.

    3 + 4 is an expression but the ; tells the result of 7 to be discarded.

    Run make and ./escape in escape_characters/ to compile and run.

0-3
    Run make and ./tabs in tabs/ to compile and run.

    Run  make and ./writer in hello_world_writer/ to compile and run.

    No. Braces are missing from the main() function body.

0-6
    Yes. The program is able to run as long as each brace is closed.

0-7 
    No. The inner */ delimits the end of the comment and it's a special char
    that should be used purely as the end of the comment, or else the comment
    will be considered as C++ code.

0-8
    Yes. The // comment says "everything after is a comment" so one may use as
    many special characters as they wish provided they're on that line.

    The shortest valid program is limited by the inclusion of a main function.
    It is good practice to explicitly have a return statement but not necessary.
    Run make and ./shortest in shortest_program/ to compile and run.

0-10
    Run  make and ./hello_nl in hello_nl/ to compile and run.
