    Intuitively this makes sense because the median could be any of the values 
    that are already read and discarding them means there is no way to get the
    value back. Here's a proof of sorts. Assume you can discard a value. There
    could be 1 unknown number. If we had discarded the first few numbers after
    finding their median was 2 (and the numbers were 0, 2, 1000), and the
    unknown number is 9001, there would be no way to know that the median is
    now 501 ((1000 + 2) / 2). QED.

    class_grades/ does not rely on division by zero since the program will
    return on improper input. Run make and ./div0 in divide_by_zero to see what
    happens in whatever C++ implementation desired (change compiler in makefile
    if necessary). For my g++ run, the terminal outputted "Floating-point
    exception".
