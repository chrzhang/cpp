    Create and initialize a vector of ints to have 10 elements, each of value
    100. Declare and create another vector, this one empty, with name v. Then
    attempt to copy values in the range of the filled vector into the empty
    vector. A segmentation fault results because the size of the empty vector is
    0 and it can only be filled with an iterator made to be an inserter_iterator
    or already have reserved enough room. This is why back_inserter is needed.

    Turn on the CORRECTION_X define macro flags in copy_vec/ to compile and run.
