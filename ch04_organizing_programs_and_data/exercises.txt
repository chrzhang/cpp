    Run make and ./grade in structs/ to compile and run. Input is terminated by
    entering EOF (Ctrl + D on Linux and Ctrl + Z on Win) to display every
    student's grades. (Also check out functions for earlier chapter examples)

    Since max() requires the types of its 2 arguments to match, calling max()
    with an int and size_t would give an error or at least a warning. To fix the
    issue, since maxlen represents a non-negative length of a string, maxlen
    should be defined as a size_t type variable as well.

    Run make and ./square in squares/ to compile and run.

    If the width given to setw is not big enough to accomodate values, the value
    will still be written and will exceed the limits. setw()'s documentation
    says that it specifies the minimum width for the next, and only the next,
    value to be printed. A more robust version is stored in robust_squares/.
    Run make and ./robust to compile and run.

    Run make and ./double in double_squares/ to compile and run.

    Run make and ./wordcount in wordcount/ to compile and run.
